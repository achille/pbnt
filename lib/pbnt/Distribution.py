By overloading these, I can treat these classes as if they are just tables with a couple of extra methods specific to the distribution class I am dealing with.  There are two advantages in particular.  First, if I need to improve performance, these classes could be implemented in C by inheriting from the numpy array object and adding the extra methods needed to deal with these objects as distributions.  Second, if I decide to change the underlying array class from numpy to numeric or to something totally different, it wont affect anything else, because everything else with be abstracted away.  This is further guaranteed by generate_index which generates an index for its class given which axes should be set and what the value of those axes are.
